	/// # Platform-specific behavior
	///
	/// This function currently corresponds to the `realpath` function on Unix
	/// and the `CreateFile` and `GetFinalPathNameByHandle` functions on Windows.
	/// Note that this [may change in the future][changes].
	///
	/// On Windows, this converts the path to use [extended length path][path]
	/// syntax, which allows your program to use longer path names, but means you
	/// can only join backslash-delimited paths to it, and it may be incompatible
	/// with other applications (if passed to the application on the command-line,
	/// or written to a file another application may read).

	/// # Errors
	///
	/// This function will return an error in the following situations, but is not
	/// limited to just these cases:
	///
	/// * `path` does not exist.
	/// * A non-final component in path is not a directory.
	///
	/// # Examples
	///
	/// ```no_run
	/// use std::fs;
	///
	/// fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
	/// 	let path = fs::canonicalize("../a/../foo.txt")?;
	/// 	Ok(())

	/// Copies the contents of one file to another. This function will also
	/// copy the permission bits of the original file to the destination file.
	///
	/// This function will **overwrite** the contents of `to`.
	///
	/// Note that if `from` and `to` both point to the same file, then the file
	/// will likely get truncated by this operation.
	///
	/// On success, the total number of bytes copied is returned and it is equal to
	/// the length of the `to` file as reported by `metadata`.
	///
	/// If you want to copy the contents of one file to another and youâ€™re
	/// working with [`File`]s, see the [`io::copy`](io::copy()) function.
	///
	/// # Platform-specific behavior
	///
	/// This function currently corresponds to the `open` function in Unix
	/// with `O_RDONLY` for `from` and `O_WRONLY`, `O_CREAT`, and `O_TRUNC` for `to`.
	/// `O_CLOEXEC` is set for returned file descriptors.
	///
	/// On Linux (including Android), this function attempts to use `copy_file_range(2)`,
	/// and falls back to reading and writing if that is not possible.
	///
	/// On Windows, this function currently corresponds to `CopyFileEx`. Alternate
	/// NTFS streams are copied but only the size of the main stream is returned by
	/// this function.
	///
	/// On MacOS, this function corresponds to `fclonefileat` and `fcopyfile`.
	///
	/// Note that platform-specific behavior [may change in the future][changes].

	///
	/// # Errors
	///
	/// This function will return an error in the following situations, but is not

	///
	/// * `from` is neither a regular file nor a symlink to a regular file.
	/// * `from` does not exist.
	/// * The current process does not have the permission rights to read `from` or write `to`.

	///
	/// fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
	/// 	fs::copy("foo.txt", "bar.txt")?; // Copy foo.txt to bar.txt

	/// Note that, this [may change in the future][changes].
	///
	/// [changes]: io#platform-specific-behavior
	///
	/// **NOTE**: If a parent of the given path doesn't exist, this function will
	/// return an error. To create a directory and all its missing parents at the
	/// same time, use the [`create_dir_all`] function.
	///
	/// # Errors
	///
	/// This function will return an error in the following situations, but is not
	/// limited to just these cases:
	///
	/// * User lacks permissions to create directory at `path`.
	/// * A parent of the given path doesn't exist. (To create a directory and all its missing
	///   parents at the same time, use the [`create_dir_all`] function.)
	/// * `path` already exists.
	///
	/// # Examples
	///
	/// ```no_run
	/// use std::fs;
	///
	/// fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {

	/// Recursively create a directory and all of its parent components if they
	/// are missing.
	///
	/// If this function returns an error, some of the parent components might have
	/// been created already.
	///
	/// If the empty path is passed to this function, it always succeeds without
	/// creating any directories.
	///
	/// # Platform-specific behavior
	///
	/// This function currently corresponds to multiple calls to the `mkdir`

	/// [changes]: io#platform-specific-behavior
	///
	/// # Errors
	///
	/// The function will return an error if any directory specified in path does not exist and
	/// could not be created. There may be other error conditions; see [`fs::create_dir`] for
	/// specifics.
	///
	/// Notable exception is made for situations where any of the directories
	/// specified in the `path` could not be created as it was being created concurrently.
	/// Such cases are considered to be successful. That is, calling `create_dir_all`
	/// concurrently from multiple threads or processes is guaranteed not to fail
	/// due to a race condition with itself.
	///
	/// [`fs::create_dir`]: create_dir
	///
	/// # Examples
	///
	/// ```no_run
	/// use std::fs;
	///

	/// ```
	fn create_dir_all<P: AsRef<path::Path>>(path: P) -> io::Result<()>;

	/// Returns `Ok(true)` if the path points at an existing entity.
	///
	/// This function will traverse symbolic links to query information about the
	/// destination file. In case of broken symbolic links this will return `Ok(false)`.
	///
	/// As opposed to the [`Path::exists`] method, this will only return `Ok(true)` or `Ok(false)`
	/// if the path was _verified_ to exist or not exist. If its existence can neither be confirmed
	/// nor denied, an `Err(_)` will be propagated instead. This can be the case if e.g. listing
	/// permission is denied on one of the parent directories.
	///
	/// Note that while this avoids some pitfalls of the `exists()` method, it still can not
	/// prevent time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) bugs. You should only use it in scenarios
	/// where those bugs are not an issue.
	///
	/// # Examples
	///
	/// ```no_run

	/// assert!(!fs::exists("does_not_exist.txt")
	/// 	.expect("Can't check existence of file does_not_exist.txt"));

	/// Creates a new hard link on the filesystem.
	///
	/// The `link` path will be a link pointing to the `original` path. Note that
	/// systems often require these two paths to both be located on the same
	/// filesystem.
	///
	/// If `original` names a symbolic link, it is platform-specific whether the
	/// symbolic link is followed. On platforms where it's possible to not follow
	/// it, it is not followed, and the created hard link points to the symbolic
	/// link itself.
	///
	/// # Platform-specific behavior
	///
	/// This function currently corresponds the `CreateHardLink` function on Windows.
	/// On most Unix systems, it corresponds to the `linkat` function with no flags.
	/// On Android, VxWorks, and Redox, it instead corresponds to the `link` function.
	/// On MacOS, it uses the `linkat` function if it is available, but on very old
	/// systems where `linkat` is not available, `link` is selected at runtime instead.
	/// Note that, this [may change in the future][changes].

	/// # Errors
	///
	/// This function will return an error in the following situations, but is not
	/// limited to just these cases:
	///
	/// * The user lacks permissions to perform `metadata` call on `path`.
	/// * `path` does not exist.
	///
	/// # Examples
	///
	/// ```rust,no_run
	/// use std::fs;
	///
	/// fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
	/// 	let attr = fs::symlink_metadata("/some/file/path.txt")?;
	/// 	// inspect attr ...
	/// 	Ok(())
	/// }
	/// ```
	fn symlink_metadata<P: AsRef<path::Path>>(path: P) -> io::Result<Metadata>;

	/// Writes a slice as the entire contents of a file.
	///
	/// This function will create a file if it does not exist,
	/// and will entirely replace its contents if it does.
	///
	/// Depending on the platform, this function may fail if the
	/// full directory path does not exist.
	///
	/// This is a convenience function for using [`File::create`] and [`write_all`]
	/// with fewer imports.
	///
	/// [`write_all`]: Write::write_all
	///
	/// # Examples
	///
	/// ```no_run
	/// use std::fs;
	///
	/// fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
	/// 	fs::write("foo.txt", b"Lorem ipsum")?;
	/// 	fs::write("bar.txt", "dolor sit")?;
	/// 	Ok(())
	/// }
	/// ```
